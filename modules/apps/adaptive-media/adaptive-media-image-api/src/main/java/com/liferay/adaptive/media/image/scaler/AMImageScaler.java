/**
 * Provides an interface that scales an image to fit the characteristics
 * specified by the image configuration entry.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface should be implemented to allow Adaptive Media to work with new
 * type of images that are supported by the out of the box image scalers or to
 * replace one of the existing image scalers by a custom one.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class need to be registed as an OSGi component. The
 * property <code>mime.type</code> defines the mime type or mime types that the
 * image scaler can handle. The special mime type <code>*</code> will be used as
 * a fallback in case there is no image scaler for a specific mime type.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Image scalers can be replaced by registering an OSGi component with a higher
 * <code>service.ranking</code> property.
