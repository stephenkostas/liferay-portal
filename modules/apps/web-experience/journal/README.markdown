# Liferay Journal

*Journal* is a module for Liferay 7.0. The Journal is part of Liferay's Web Experience Management which provides a full enterprise solution for web publishing and allows non-technical users to publish content to a Liferay site without having advanced knowledge of web technology or programming.

Liferay Journal is part of the Liferay Portal project.
[Liferay Portal]
(http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-portal) is an
open source enterprise web platform for building business solutions that deliver
immediate results and long-term value. Liferay Portal started out as a personal
development project in 2000 and was open sourced in 2001.

To get started, check out the project's community homepage at

### Liferay Developer Network

The [Liferay Developer Network](https://dev.liferay.com) \(LDN\) at
<http://dev.liferay.com>, is the best place to learn about Liferay. It has over
200 tutorials, guided learning, and much more.

LDN's [Learning Paths](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths) are a
great place to learn how to develop on Liferay, especially if you're new to
Liferay development. As you gain experience developing on Liferay, you'll want
to dive into [Tutorials](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials) for details
on leveraging Liferay's technologies and frameworks. If you create apps that you
want to share or sell, you can read LDN's
[Distribute](https://dev.liferay.com/distribute) section to learn how to publish
the apps to the Liferay Marketplace.

The Liferay Developer Network is not only your home for Liferay development, but
it's also your place to [participate](https://dev.liferay.com/participate) in
making Liferay better. Come check out the [Liferay Developer
Network](https://dev.liferay.com).
